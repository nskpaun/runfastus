The treadmill is where you go when you don’t want to face the cold of winter. The treadmill is where you go for a nice cushy bouncy surface to run on so you don’t need strong joint. You don’t need to be connected with your body on a treadmill because you can put on a program and forget about it. You don’t even need to face the pain your body experiences because you can put on a Netflix drama to distract you.</p>\n<p>Treadmills are loud. Treadmills are smelly. Treadmills are usually in a stuffy, dusty gym. The have unwieldy buttons. They’re incredibly dangerous to fall off of! Some treadmills are unpowered. That doesn’t work too well. The experience of being on a treadmill is bad every single time.</p>\n<p>Alas, treadmills are an essential tool for the runner. We runners want to run far and fast. We don’t listen to our bodies anymore. We’ve transcended. But sometimes, the only thing I can do during recovery is run a limited distance, for a limited time, on a bouncy awful treadmill.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Treadmills","date":"January 17, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/treadmills/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tools-for-running/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tools For Running"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/biomechanics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Biomechanics"}}}}
