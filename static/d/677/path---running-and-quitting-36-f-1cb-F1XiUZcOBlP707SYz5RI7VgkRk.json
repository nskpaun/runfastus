Run 10 miles, every day, for 7 days in a row. My highest weekly mileage of all time was 55 miles. This will be the most I have run in a week, a 27% increase (I am aware of a 10% rule for which I have no regard). Normally I don’t do stuff like this. I usually am looking to get a certain time in a race. To that end, I do a combination of long runs, track workouts, tempos, and recovery runs. This is a whole different challenge. Seven, best effort, 10 mile runs in a row.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/b80f6/forcesofpain.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 83.82978723404257%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Battle the forces of pain and exhaustion\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/f8fb9/forcesofpain.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/e8976/forcesofpain.jpg 148w,\n/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/63df2/forcesofpain.jpg 295w,\n/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/f8fb9/forcesofpain.jpg 590w,\n/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/85e3d/forcesofpain.jpg 885w,\n/static/cac3f0241d4e159094d1403bd71590c5/b80f6/forcesofpain.jpg 940w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I am now finished with my fourth day of the challenge. I have already accomplished something I have never accomplished before (40 miles in 4 days). I am not injured. I have the time in my schedule blocked out. I can do this. I am tired. Very tired. The energy is drained from my body. My muscles want nothing more than to take the three-day recovery they deserve before the next onslaught. My mind is sluggish. My will is weak. I find myself asking,</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Recently I was asked what The Order of Runfastus stands for. My answer was to state the truths we hold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Runfastus lives.</li>\n<li>Runfastus’ influence is felt.</li>\n<li>The highest virtue is speed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What can we find in these truths to keep us going in times of weakness? What lines of reasoning can we construct to justify our pain? I tell you the truth, these kinds of questions are nonsensical. They reflect a fatal flaw the patterns of the thinking of this age.</p>\n<p>The reason that I will endure is because of the influence of Runfastus. I reject modern reasoning. I do not persevere for bragging rights on Strava, nor to achieve a personal milestone. I do not persevere so that I can race faster nor is this just part of my training program. I don’t persevere because I have a community of runners supporting me nor do I have a coach giving me the motivation I need.</p>\n<p>I refuse to fill my head with the noise and distraction of reason. I need precisely the life of Runfastus to battle the forces of pain and exhaustion. That is the meaning of his living. It is enough. The life of Runfastus embodies everything I need to keep me going. Yet there is nothing that Runfastus embodies that can be directly described and analyzed.</p>\n<p>I will let this endurance challenge be an exercise in deep meditation on Runafastus. The end will be to achieve a deeper state to capture the true spirit of running. Even this reasoning is a crutch that I shall shed when I reach the truth. Runfastus lives.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When Runners Want to Quit","date":"February 10, 2019","guest_author":null,"tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/running-and-quitting/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/speedrunning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Revelations for Runners from Speedrunning"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/timecommitments/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Time Commitments of A Runner's Lifestyle"}}}}
