Like something you need a degree or two to really understand. But it really isn’t all that mysterious. Everyone already knows some biomechanics. If you jump off a balcony and land feet first, you’re probably well aware that you’ll break an ankle or a leg. Look you’re a natural! We don’t need to be doctors, we just want to know enough to run fast. If we’re going to run fast we have to learn to think for ourselves and not just go off of conventional or trend-based wisdom. So let’s talk about something every runner should have an opinion about, your stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to live on the edge between injury and speed you should know what different kinds of strides are doing for you. It’s plainly obvious (I hope) that the fastest way to run is on your toes. You get maximum power from your calves that way. Try running that way for 10 miles, however, and you’re likely to end up with some kind of injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that in order to prevent injury you should run with more of your foot on the ground and in fact you would be right in saying that would prevent a calf for ankle injury. It could be good or bad for your feet, but I’ll leave that as a puzzle for you to think about. But now you’d be dealing with a different issue. You see, preventing injury in a running stride is all about you that force gets distributed to the various joints in your body. Your body is like a spring. The more coils in an otherwise identical spring, the more distributed the force is and the less likely it is permanently deform or fail. The same principle applies to your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think of the body has having a few different coils: feet, ankles, knees, hips, and back. Perhaps there are more. Decide for yourself. So when your foot strikes the ground the force first goes into your foot and then gets transferred into your ankle, then to your knees, then to your hip, and finally to your back. The more each of those stages flex, the less force it will transfer to the next stage. So if you run on your toes, your foot and ankle can absorb that much more force and pass less to your knees and hips and back. Now you know why sprinters run on their toes; they have the maximum amount of force to deal with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if you run in trainers and strike the ground with your heel? In that case you’re essentially taking the ankle and foot out of the equation. All the force from the impact travels through those joints straight into your knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t necessarily a bad thing and doesn’t mean you should always run on your midsoles (a happy balance between heel striking and running on your toes, my personal favorite stride and the most popular trend right now (although prescribing a stride to runners is going out of style)). What you should do with this knowledge is use it to your advantage and choose when to use what stride. If your ankles are hurting, go ahead and heel strike for a while. If your having issues with your back then try getting on your toes more. Learn about your body, experiment with it, and run fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Treadmills]]></title><description><![CDATA[Treadmills hold no glory for the runner.

The treadmill is where you go when you don’t want to face the cold of winter. The treadmill is where you go for a nice cushy bouncy surface to run on so you don’t need strong joint. You don’t need to be connected with your body on a treadmill because you can put on a program and forget about it. You don’t even need to face the pain your body experiences because you can put on a Netflix drama to distract you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treadmills are loud. Treadmills are smelly. Treadmills are usually in a stuffy, dusty gym. The have unwieldy buttons. They’re incredibly dangerous to fall off of! Some treadmills are unpowered. That doesn’t work too well. The experience of being on a treadmill is bad every single time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, treadmills are an essential tool for the runner. We runners want to run far and fast. We don’t listen to our bodies anymore. We’ve transcended. But sometimes, the only thing I can do during recovery is run a limited distance, for a limited time, on a bouncy awful treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tools For Running]]></title><description><![CDATA[Running shoes are a wealth of interest for a runner.

As I’ve matured in the sport, I’ve expanded my arsenal of running shoes to be prepared to run in every situation. These are my meditations on running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My philosophy: Choosing running shoe is about teetering on the edge of speed and injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trainers: They’re designed to keep you from getting injured (as far as I can tell). They’re bulky, they have a huge drop restricting the power generated by your calves, and tend to be inflexible as well. I only run in these when I’m injured in my ankle or foot because they’re slow and boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Drop Trainers: These tend to be my preferred running shoe. They make it easy to strike with the midsole or otherwise take the impact into some part of the forefoot. This is important because it allows you to take your impact into your ankle instead of just your knee and you hip. For this reason these are actually the ideal shoe to keep from getting injured. You can also get more power and run faster than you can in trainers. Altra brand running shoes are zero drop which is really great but they can be really tough on your calves if you’re not careful. The Brooks Pure Running series helped me ease into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Flats: I use these when I want to run fast on roads. They are the minimal amount of shoe you need to keep your skin off the pavement. I love these shoes, but I can’t help but feel guilty for crushing my joints on the pavement with no cushioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikes: I only use these on the track. Obviously the spikes give traction, but some have a more interesting feature. They have a negative drop. Yes the toe has more shoe under it than the ankle. This really gets you on your toes and you can really fly. It’s thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barefoot: Barefoot running is not fast and gets you injured. I have no reason to ever run barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more kinds of shoes out there like trail shoes, sandals, Vibrams, Nike Free series shoes, etc. I haven’t tried any of them so I can’t comment, but given their commercial success, I imagine choosing a running shoe is much deeper than I know&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
