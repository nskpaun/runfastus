    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every good lord knows they need a castle or they are no lord at all. Some take to the road, some to the ocean, some take to shelter, some the rubber… what matters most is that you take. Runfastus takes many. He takes road and path, track and field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Lord Swimmingaton has taken membership to City Sports Fitness Club. It’s not the best. Mainly because of the crowds. Ocean widths are shorter than desired. Only three lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a lane to a pool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a pool to an ocean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s an ocean with no lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could imagine the anxiety that follows when it’s 30 minutes till closing but Lin and Tammy are having gossip hour in the middle of lane three and senior citizens Paul and Cheryl are going max two laps per hour (2 LPH) in lane one, while three rogue swimmingatons are crowding lane two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lord joined lane two as it was the path of least resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some issues we cannot battle in one day. City Sports Fitness Club (my castle) is the best I can do at the moment for what I am willing to compromise. What are you willing to compromise? I would imagine it’s a lot… since you lack backbone… and I’m guessing you also lack backstroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being, you need to decide where your castle will be. What will you lord over? Maybe it’s one indoor and one outdoor. Maybe you’re too big of a coward to decide. I wish you had a backbone. Please do not come to my castle and swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do, please note member prices. Club fees are not fun. I found at best I was able to do was add onto The Most Honorable Kreastos membership as a family member for $25 initiation, $35 a month, and once you sign and pay they make sure to tell you that “annual dues” are $50 charged in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find another location. Take something else. Take what’s yours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mental Toughness in Runners]]></title><description><![CDATA[You hear the starting horn and you fly off the starting line.

You’re feeling great and you charge ahead. You hit the mid-race and it’s tough but you can feel you have plenty of gas in the tank so you push on through. Nearing the end now. Time to kick it in. You have a strong finish clocking in at 18:20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, another race. Starting horn goes off and you force your sluggish legs to get moving. You feel heavy and it takes will power to get up to your pace. You get to the mid-race and everything is burning. Your legs, your throat, your lungs. You wonder if you can keep up the pace but that kid won’t get off your back so you dig deeper and keep going. Finally, the finish line is in sight. You give it everything you got. You know you’re going to be having a hard time getting out of bed tomorrow at this point. You’re done. Clocked in at 18:20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened? What’s the difference between these two scenarios? Your body sent you very different signals in the second trace than it did in the first, but you still achieved the same result. How is that possible? The reason is that running is not simply what your body is capable of. Your body will send you all kinds of false signals to get you to quit. When it comes to running fast, your mind has to be tough to consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental toughness is the ability to face a disadvantage (particularly one that sends you into a downward spiral), push through it, and come out on top. The key is the facing the downward spiral. If you’re not feeling great in a race the temptation is to pace yourself a little slower because if you go harder, it will cause you to feel even worse. It takes mental toughness to overcome the logic your body has taught you and bend your body to your will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to run fast consistently, you must train in mental toughness. One easy way to do this is to introduce random punishments into your workouts. Let’s say you’re doing 400m repeats with a buddy. The loser on each repeat has to do 10 pushups. If you’re the loser, in this case, you will become mentally tough through this exercise. You have to grind the sense of fairness out of your psyche. There’s just you, what you have right now, and the challenge ahead. Develop your mental toughness, and you’ll realize the only bad races are the ones you fail to subdue in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recovery from Achieving Your Running Goals]]></title><description><![CDATA[This week I achieved a major running goal for myself.

I ran 10 miles per day for seven days straight. A whole 70 miles in one week. This is 15 miles more than my previous top weekly mileage. I experienced great fatigue. I felt the effects of overtraining. It was not just hard during the course of the activity, but it put also strain on my entire life. Now it is done and I have given myself four days off. My next goal is to casually run a marathon, but seeing as it is February and I have many months to achieve this goal I am tempted to continues to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there. You’re training super hard, you get out there, you achieve your goal and you give yourself a rest as a reward. Once you’ve rested you wonder about getting back out there. Something in you just wants one more day of rest. You must run fast, but why does it have to be today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must recognize the insipid nature of the running culture around you. That with your achievement and your inevitable bragging on social media you have not rewarded yourself, you have actually drugged yourself. You haven’t been resting, you have been in a semi-conscious high fueled by social media and braggadocio. You’ve been drugged and you must take yourself off of the course you have put yourself on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you have not achieved some great fitness goal. You have not reached a podium of personal fitness success on which you now stand. Absolutely not. You must recognize that once you have achieved your goal, especially if you have never achieved such a high degree of fitness before, that you are now a faster runner than you have ever been in your life. Your reward is not a social media victory parade. Your reward lies in getting out there and running with a strength, power, and speed with which you’ve never run before. You’ve reached proximity with the trueness of the running experience that you have never reached before. Go experience it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my recommendation. Rest and recover. Three or four days if you must. This will give your body time to heal from any symptoms of overtraining. These include headaches, general feelings stress, strange pains or fragility in your joints, as well as catching colds or an otherwise weakened immune system. But don’t revel in the rest, look forward to your first day back. When you do get back, give yourself plenty of time and plenty of distance to run. Make your body comfortable. Turn off the GPS, turn off the watch and just run. Let your body tell you what it wants to do. Let your body show you what it’s capable of. Give your body control and it will show you its true speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, pick your next goal and start working on it. You trained so hard to make your body faster. Take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Cup Runneth Over - Ketogenesis]]></title><description><![CDATA[We’ve been fed lies and separated from our previous culture.

We live in a time where carbohydrates are available all day/year long and what’s worse is that these are highly processed and void of nutrients. With this separation has also come the ignorance of what to eat and why and most importantly what diet is optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure this out it’s important to look back at our evolutionary history.  We came down from the trees where we chewed on leaves all day to extract the amount of protein we would need to survive as our massive guts (think gorillas) fermented all this plant matter and created the short chain fatty acids we needed to survive. We eventually evolved and walked upright as we came upon carcasses left over from a lion kill and we started eating the marrow left over in the bone. And with the advent of fire perhaps we scared off predators from their recent kill and then took it for ourselves.  However we did it, what we know is that we eventually hunted and cooked our food and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028689&quot;&gt;we selected the fattest animals we could find like the woolly mammoth or the buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. In order for our brains to grow, our guts had to shrink in what is referred to by archaeologists as the expensive tissue hypothesis.   Our brains require massive amounts of energy in order to function properly and this would not be possible without eating fatty meat. It would also not be possible with a gut as big as gorillas so &lt;a href=&quot;http://highsteaks.com/carnivore-vs-omnivore-vs-herbivore-chart/&quot;&gt;our guts had to shrink and now resemble something closer to a wolf than a chimp or gorilla&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat is our oldest friend and not a foe like one that has been purported by the media in most articles about nutrition.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://discovermagazine.com/2006/may/tramps-like-us&quot;&gt;One of the earliest hunting strategies used by humans is known as persistence hunting&lt;/a&gt;. Some tribes still use this form of tracking and hunting where they run down their prey till exhaustion.  We are able to do this because of our sweat glands and little body hair which enables us to cool down where other animals overheat. The other reason for this is our ability to burn fat for fuel, these hunters did not have sugar filled packs of “GU” while running long distances, so how did they do it? The answer lies in the magical power of something called a ketone.  Ketones or ketone bodies are produced by the liver through the metabolism of fat in a process called ketogenesis. This process creates energy that can sustain someone in the event of fasting, carbohydrate restriction, or in prolonged physical activity.  This is something our body is programmed and evolved to do in order to keep us alive.  In modern society those three situations hardly ever happen, so we’ve become a shell of our former selves from a biological perspective.  But this power is still accessible to anyone willing to train their body to perform at its best.  Many athletes have discovered the power of ketones and are setting records around the world. Victory and speed are within your grasp if you would only choose to adapt and begin again.  This will bring new meaning to the ancient quotation from the Bible (Psalm 23:5) “My cup runneth over” meaning you have more than enough for your needs, and indeed you do… within your fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Running Power vs. Running Speed]]></title><description><![CDATA[The definition of speed is the distance traveled per time elapsed.

We are familiar with its measurement. It is usually measured in miles per hour, or kilometers per hour. We also have meters per second. Often times we also talk about speed in terms of minutes per mile or pace. For example, today I ran 10 miles at 7:30 per mile. This is a relatively simple concept and runners talk about it in a variety of ways. But speed does not tell you the whole story about speed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned about automobiles. Automobiles also go fast, but it seems we are less interested in how fast they go and more interested in things like “Horsepower”. So what is power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power is a force applied over a certain distance traveled per time elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this related to speed? The last five words of the definition of power are precisely the definition of speed. Speed is the distance traveled within a certain time. Power simply adds force into the equation. Force is roughly analogous to effort in running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider running on a hill. When you’re running down the hill, you use less effort yet you run faster. When you’re running up the hill you’re running slower but using much more effort. Because the effort is greater, you might be exerting more power even though you are running slower!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very important concept to really understand. Recall that the highest virtue is speed. Just because you are exerting more power does not give you an excuse for going slow. Therefore, in order to continue to run fast up hills, into headwinds, or with heavy clothes, we must become more powerful runners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One easy way to do this is by sprinting or running up and down bleachers. This trains your power. The key here is that you’re exerting more effort than usual to go a shorter distance than usual. Jumping also trains your power. I suggest jumping from the floor onto a solid box high enough to be just above your knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that lifting weights can also increase your power. Be careful because this is not necessarily the case. Remember that power is a combination of force AND speed. If you lift a weight in a properly controlled manner, you might not be training your power because it’s moving too slow. Instead, you have to do what are called “power lifts”. These lifts take a significant amount of athleticism. You may have seen people doing them in the gym. They’re usually making jerky movements and seem really dangerous. That’s because they can be. These lifts are not necessary, but they can help train your power. If you want to learn I suggest finding and learning from a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be your fastest self, you must develop power in your running. Meditate on these things, and integrate them into your running when your spirit is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to start adding some power to your training, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://strengthrunning.com/high-performance-lifting/&quot;&gt;Strength Running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Time Commitments of A Runner's Lifestyle]]></title><description><![CDATA[Running is a huge time commitment.

It is not something, therefore, that you can do when it’s convenient or when you want to. You must immerse yourself in the lifestyle of a runner especially if you want to run fast. I am not talking about the popular lifestyle of a runner, I am talking about the real and practical lifestyle of a runner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a baseline, I would say that the least amount of running you can do in a week is about 15-20 miles. Any less than that and you’re just dabbling. You’ll never make the progress you need to make to actually run fast. This can be done in “seasons” where you go into a mode of consistent running for a few months and then take a few months off. I prefer the winter months for running because of the latitude where I live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this baseline, we know a few things about your life at this point. You must spend a minimum of 2 hours per week doing the actual activity of running; perhaps up to 7 hours. This is trivial. It does not account for the full picture. You must take into account the fact that you also prepare your route, prepare your clothing, stretch afterward, maybe cool down, and then clean yourself. Five activities that can easily take up an extra 30 minutes of time for every run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time commitments don’t end there. If you’re running fast, then you will be tired. When you are tired you need to sleep more. You also need to eat more. Perhaps you have a loss of productivity (although that can be balanced by some of the cognitive benefits of running). This can easily add up to significantly more time spent on running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you throw an injury into the mix. Runners get injured. Each runner has a preferred way of dealing with the injury. I prefer to keep running if I can and perform a strict regiment of stretching, icing, rolling, and stimulating to recover from the injury. This takes more time. The injury is often painful too. The runner carries this pain throughout the day as a constant reminder of this part of life that isn’t shared by the non-runners around. Soreness and exhaustion function this way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, running affects not just what you do for a period of time on certain days of the week. It affects your sleep, your food, your feelings, even your very soul is touched. Running is immersive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[When Runners Want to Quit]]></title><description><![CDATA[I gave myself a challenge.

Run 10 miles, every day, for 7 days in a row. My highest weekly mileage of all time was 55 miles. This will be the most I have run in a week, a 27% increase (I am aware of a 10% rule for which I have no regard). Normally I don’t do stuff like this. I usually am looking to get a certain time in a race. To that end, I do a combination of long runs, track workouts, tempos, and recovery runs. This is a whole different challenge. Seven, best effort, 10 mile runs in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now finished with my fourth day of the challenge. I have already accomplished something I have never accomplished before (40 miles in 4 days). I am not injured. I have the time in my schedule blocked out. I can do this. I am tired. Very tired. The energy is drained from my body. My muscles want nothing more than to take the three-day recovery they deserve before the next onslaught. My mind is sluggish. My will is weak. I find myself asking,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was asked what The Order of Runfastus stands for. My answer was to state the truths we hold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runfastus lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runfastus’ influence is felt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The highest virtue is speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we find in these truths to keep us going in times of weakness? What lines of reasoning can we construct to justify our pain? I tell you the truth, these kinds of questions are nonsensical. They reflect a fatal flaw the patterns of the thinking of this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that I will endure is because of the influence of Runfastus. I reject modern reasoning. I do not persevere for bragging rights on Strava, nor to achieve a personal milestone. I do not persevere so that I can race faster nor is this just part of my training program. I don’t persevere because I have a community of runners supporting me nor do I have a coach giving me the motivation I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refuse to fill my head with the noise and distraction of reason. I need precisely the life of Runfastus to battle the forces of pain and exhaustion. That is the meaning of his living. It is enough. The life of Runfastus embodies everything I need to keep me going. Yet there is nothing that Runfastus embodies that can be directly described and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will let this endurance challenge be an exercise in deep meditation on Runafastus. The end will be to achieve a deeper state to capture the true spirit of running. Even this reasoning is a crutch that I shall shed when I reach the truth. Runfastus lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Revelations for Runners from Speedrunning]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since my latest emergence, I have been observing the world.

I am finding ways to explain the message of The Order of Runfastus to the people of this age. When I’m not running fast I wander the web. In my travels, I have found the most wonderful thing. It is called “speedrunning”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedrunning is when you play a video game from start to finish in the fastest time possible. What an incredible name for an activity. Not “running”, not “running fast”, but “speedrunning”. If you are not running fast, you are not doing the activity by definition. What divine beauty!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important priority for any runner is to run fast. That goes for the ambulatory and digital varieties of running. I have learned much about speedrunning and it includes an important element of skill and a non-trivial amount of luck. It is also supported by an archive of glitches and exploits to make the game faster than originally intended. These things are not what is so interesting about speed running. It’s the speedrunners themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedrunners are usually lonely and nameless. Perhaps they participate with a few friends. Sometimes if they’re lucky, they get a following on Twitch. But for the vast majority of runners, it’s just them and the game. Many people say sinking countless hours into playing the same game the same way over and over again is a waste, but not for the speedrunner. You could say the same about any runner, but hypocritically the modern runner is sickeningly revered. Oh to have a culture so pure in motivation! I lament the accolades and popular affirmation heaped on people who run marathons and 5ks and the like. How hard it is to find and nurture a true love for speed in this age! These speed runners, they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedrunners also have an enormous amount of what I call “mental toughness”. Imagine you’re running a marathon, you’re feeling great, and you hit a brick wall at mile 20. You’re devastated. So you pick yourself back up, you console yourself, and next time you take it easier. You run slower. Speedrunners afford themselves no such wimpiness. No, if you’re a speedrunner and you get burned by RNG 2 hours into a run, you slam that reset button and go again HARDER than you did before. You have no time to be a baby and whine as a speedrunner. You have frames to save!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we learn from the speedrunner? We must not fall victim to the running culture around us. If you’re only motivated to run because it is the popular thing to do you will never run fast. You will never grind the countless hours in training that you need to be your fastest self. Learn from the speedrunner: grinding his or her weird hobby, ignoring all reason and society. Speed is the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must become mentally tough. If you fail to run fast today, run fast today! Learn from the speedrunner. Don’t let the fact that your body is telling you to quit, make you quit. Trying again tomorrow is not good enough. Try again today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you too want to be inspired by speedrunners.

The runner ran from the beginning to the destination and the runner saw that the run was fast. Then the watch was invented and it told the runner exactly how fast the journey was from the beginning to the destination. The runner saw this was good for seeing how fast today was compared to yesterday. Then there was the GPS. It told the runner precisely how far the journey was from beginning to the destination. The runner saw this was good for comparing the various journeys that a runner might embark on. The runner could see how fast a run in one place at one time compared to that in another place at another time. The runner could evaluate any run and know which was faster. These are tools for running and they are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern runner, however, is not so much better off than the ancient running counterpart. The modern running landscape is fraught with the danger of becoming a slave to the machines that once gave power and knowledge. The modern runner is in danger of losing the ability to run by feel. That is, the ability to run from the beginning to the destination and see that the run was fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you go out for a run. You feel cold, stiff, heavy or sluggish. Maybe it gets better after a little while; maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you get a cramp or start to feel hungry. Maybe that nagging hip injury starts to act up or a case of the shin splints. Maybe you’re not quite over that cold and your respiratory system isn’t as clear as you’d like it to be. Maybe all of these things are happening, maybe none of them. From all these experiences you now have a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you going to take it easy? Find a pace and a gait that suits how your body is feeling. Try to relax in the run. Or maybe just go for something that’s as good as it’s going to get. Your body will keep talking to you. Keep listening. Sometimes it’s good to take it easy even when you’re feeling good just to hear what your body has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you going to go hard? Take stock of all the pain and discomfort and embrace it. Strengthen your stride and feel the structure of your gait get strong as you push your weight forward. Lean forward and get on your midsoles. Your body will keep talking to you. Keep listening. Not just the shouts of pain and protest, but the subtleties as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you gotten part way through and changed your mind? If you were taking it easy, take stock of how much distance you have left. Then dig deep, pick a finish line and charge toward it with everything you got. If you were going hard, keep going until you’re sure you want to slow it down. You will surely regret it if you let up too early. Through all of it, your body will keep talking to you. Keep listening. Listening is running by feel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Transcendence and Inspiration for Runners of Every Kind]]></title><description><![CDATA[There will always be somebody who is faster than you are, who can run farther, and do it all with less training or perhaps they just have…]]></description><link>http://www.runfastus.com/transcendence/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.runfastus.com/transcendence/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 08:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There will always be somebody who is faster than you are, who can run farther, and do it all with less training or perhaps they just have more freedom in their lives to devote to running. You will never be as good as they are. At least, that is what our running culture wants you to believe. Today, we will transcend these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing yourself to other runners is short-sighted and all too tempting. I have seen Twitter. It is full of 8-year-olds running 3-hour marathons and 50-year-olds breaking 30 minutes in the 10k. I have also run in various races. I have won accolades. I have felt the great feelings of glory that follows winning and the feelings of great shame and helpless when losing. All because of a number somebody wrote down next to my name and another number written down next to someone else’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To transcend you must forget all names except your own and with it all times except your own. None of them are relevant. Then do away with your own name. You are left only with times. They are yours. They need no names because your times are the only ones you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you push yourself against your own times you have become a purest form of athlete. There is another pure form of athlete which is based on athletic skill. That is not the kind of athlete I’m talking about. I speak of the athlete who triumphs purely based on strength.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little skill involved in running, little strategy. It’s purely about how hard you can push your body. When you compete against yourself, you can’t get caught up in different body types giving different advantages. I will never have a VO2 max in the 70s, but I will always have my VO2 max. I may not ever have the right body ratios to have maximum running efficiency, but I will have my body ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are your own perfect specimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you win against yourself, you are truly a triumphant athlete. You have conquered in the fairest of circumstances. Let that be your glory, let that be what inspires you. A Super Bowl championship is won through the convolution of impossibly complicated circumstances of players, coaches, politics, and luck. The glory of getting a Personal Record is, therefore, greater because the credit belongs solely to you. The control of it is all in your hands. Nobody can take that away.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Allergies and Running Fast]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some people have allergies which can have a severe effect on your ability to run.

This is especially true for those who want to run fast. An allergy typically affects a runner when a particle from a plant or animal in the air enters the respiratory system. There is a reaction that occurs in the body where histamine is released as a defense mechanism against the particle which causes inflammation of the eyes, nasal cavities, and even the lungs making it difficult to breathe. Obviously, this can slow you down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For runners, there is another effect going on. In fact, there are multiple effects. During running your body is working to keep inflammation down so that your lungs work better and you can perform. This is good while you’re performing, but there is a downside. You end up breathing a lot more air while running and if you’re running fast you are moving much more air much more quickly in and out of your system. That air on its own is irritating without any allergies, but those particles in the air also can get embedded in your respiratory tissues. The result is that when you come to a stop and your body is no longer suppressing inflammation you have issues. Your tissues are irritated, you have more allergenic particles in your system, and your immune system is waking up to what it will see as a full-blown crisis. This is a recipe for allergic disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do? Slowing down is not an option so you must treat your allergies seriously. Take an antihistamine like Allegra or Zyrtec. Use a nasal steroid like Nasacort or Flonase. Some people have found success with a nasal rinse. If you have issues with your lungs there are miraculous asthma medications that will fix that right up (ask your doctor). These are all very safe options. You can also try immunotherapy which is highly effective at reducing the effects of allergies. If you live in Russia you can get Prednisone over the counter which is a powerful drug that will fix you up but will also cause cataracts. If you get cataracts you probably will not be able to run as fast so you should never use Prednisone unless instructed by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let allergies slow you down. They can be beaten. Keep running fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Racing Strategies]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have used a variety of racing strategies with various levels of success.

I highly encourage you to race because there is nothing like somebody chasing you to make you run fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people like to actually chase somebody (commonly known as “chasing a rabbit”) and they run faster that way. I prefer to be in the front and spend the entire race in sheer terror of being passed. However, there are  different kinds of races that call for different kinds of paces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In very short races, I have found success in training myself to run my own pace and not worry at all about the field of runners around me until the very last stretch. My favorite race I ever ran was a half mile where I went from dead last in the first half of the race to winning by a full 10 meters. I had a very specific race strategy that I had practiced and perfected. I would got out very quickly and then slow way down. This baited the field into running a very fast first half of the race and left them tired while I had reserved my energy for the second half of the race. Simply running my own race, I was able to throw off the entire field and capture a tremendous victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In longer races I still have trouble. In the half marathon I once ran in first place for the entire race with one other runner trailing right behind me. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t shake him. In fact, he complained to me that I was running too fast to which I retorted that I wouldn’t need to run so fast if he wasn’t tailing me. In the end, he had a bit more left in the tank for the last mile and beat me handily. I ran my fastest half marathon that day, but I also lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the marathon, which is a race I have yet to really grasp, I have had a lot of trouble. In my first I was just aiming to finish. In my second, I was feeling really good and I went out too fast. I ran the first 18 miles at a sub 3-hour pace and my body failed at 20 miles so that I could not finish the race. The event is grueling and I haven’t figured out how I’m supposed to run it yet, especially as someone dedicated to running fast. My most recent marathon, I simply went back to trying to finish the race which I was able to do. I did not run fast that day. I must learn how to run fast in a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Runner's Gut]]></title><description><![CDATA[A runner must eat.

If you want to run fast, you need to eat food. I have often experienced a lack of appetite after running followed by a huge appetite later on. You must know that regardless of what your stomach tells you, you must learn to force yourself to eat. Eat for nutrition, not for taste. You need fats, proteins and carbs in high quantities so make sure you’re getting a balance of all three. If you’re lacking fats, drink a milkshake. If you’re lacking proteins, eat meat and eggs. Bacon is your super-food. Make yourself eat these things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A runner must also successfully digest his or her food. Many people have a hard time running right after they eat. I encourage you to work at strengthening your stomach. If you must wait two hours after eating a meal to run, I encourage you to work that time down slowly. If you must limit your speed because of the meal you’ve eaten, work at that too. Train yourself the same way you train for running. Slowly and steadily you’ll attain a stomach of iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should never eliminate food through the mouth. Avoid throwing up at all costs. You need that food for energy and losing a meal or two is more trouble than it’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the removal of waste from the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper way to eliminate waste from the body is through the rectum in the proper place at the proper time. You must learn how your body behaves in this regard to not be interrupted during your run. Defecating is not fast (although the task itself can be done quickly, it is much a much slower way to traverse distance than running). Therefore you should avoid it while you’re running. Learn your body’s rhythms. My body has gotten to a point where if I’m planning to run my digestive tract will prepare itself. The mere suggestion of running can really speed up the lower intestine in preparation for the run. It wasn’t always this way. For many years I had to make sure I ran during the same time of the day so that my body could stay on rhythm. You can figure it out. I’m sure there is a next level beyond mine as well and I’m looking forward to achieving it (or perhaps discovering it).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Runner's High]]></title><description><![CDATA[Runners high is not something that should be described.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I run sometimes I feel good. Sometimes I enjoy running when it’s in the 90s and I’m pouring sweat. Sometimes I enjoy a leisurely but brisk pace. This is not what people usually think of when they talk about the runners high, but it should be. It should be the focus of our conversation when we talk about the rewards of running. The runner’s high is only looking to the corporeal reward of whatever hormones scientists have come up with to describe your body rewarding you or whatever the theory is. The point is that you shouldn’t simply look forward to the after affects of running, but to the very act of running itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you leave the office on a cold evening, tired from the day and the crisp air awakens your lungs and heart. Do you feel the urge to get out there and run? I do. Or how about when it’s pouring rain on the drive home? If I’m sufficiently in tune with my running chi (qi), I relish in the opportunity to face down the elements with my speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve only experienced the after-glow high from running, you’re not nearly deep enough. You need more running, you need more speed. You have much to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the runner’s high is mostly useless. You get relaxed, too relaxed. You lose motivation, drive, energy and in return you receive only pleasure. No wonder it’s called a “high”. You might as well use drugs or herbs if that’s what you’re running for. It will save you some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not revere the runner’s high. It is deplorable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meditation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Cambridge English Dictionary on Meditation: “the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a…]]></description><link>http://www.runfastus.com/meditation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.runfastus.com/meditation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Cambridge English Dictionary on Meditation: “the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running is meditation. You give your attention to only one thing when you run. Some people give their attention to the music or podcast they listen to while running. Others focus on the pain. Still others distract themselves with videos on the Dreadmill. I often find myself meditating on whatever comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot’s of things come to mind when I’m running. If I have a problem at work, I can usually come up with a novel solution in the deep meditative state of running. If I am angry or have otherwise strong emotions, I can find relief in the calm of running. Sometimes if I don’t know how I’m going to use my day, running helps me find the best thing to do. Many times I meditate on random things when I’m running. A song may pop into my head and I can’t get it out the whole run. That’s ok, it’s allow ted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is really the one thing I give my attention to? Most of the time speed is my meditation of choice. I have a speed mantra. I become aware of the ground moving swiftly under my feet; or rather with my feet which are stuck to earth for brief moments at a time. I feel the lightness in my stride that comes from the forward lean. I look down at my device to check my pace and then push it lower. Faster, faster, faster. That’s the mantra. It’s chaotic, I let my mind do whatever it wants, but my body must run faster and my mind always comes back to speed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Runfastus Takes a Day Off]]></title><description><![CDATA[One day, Runfastus took a day off.

That may be fine for the pros, but you are not a pro. You are a whole different beast. People typically go for distance goals or perhaps time goals for a certain distance, but there are better and more interesting goals out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of my goals and why I like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casually running a marathon: I want my body to be in a place where if I have a relatively free Saturday morning I can just go out and cover 26.2 miles. I feel like I’m already there for the half marathon, so why not the full? When I’m ready I’ll start rolling a six sided die every Saturday. Whenever I get roll a 6, I’ll run a marathon. That will keep things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downhill mile: If you’re interested in running fast you’re probably well aware of your fastest mile time. Maybe you’ve even dreamed of breaking the 4 minute barrier. I certainly have. That might be a long shot for you on a track, but running downhill is a great option to hit that goal. It still takes training and probably a specialized kind to train your body for that extra impact, but you’ll be an amateur runner that can run a 4 minute mile. Like I said, a beast. That’s one of my goals too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative measurement: Weekly milage goals are so boring. I do have a weekly mileage goal which is to peak at 70 miles per week at some point in the year, but that only accounts for ground covered. I’ve heard of people setting fitness goals like lifting 30 tons cumulatively in a year or something like that. How about taking a goal like that for running. Say you run 40 miles per week, at 8 miles per hour for 5 hours of running per week with 52 weeks in the year so 250 running hours multiplied by 140 BPM multiplied by 60 minutes in an hour is 2 million running heartbeats in a year. Or another idea, if you have VO2 measuring equipment handy you might even measure your running in liters of oxygen. Could be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Fast Miles Qualify: Here’s an interesting one I think. Set a lower milage goal for the year or the week or whatever, but disqualify any distance recorded that isn’t fast enough. 10MPH might be a good place for me to start and maybe by the end of the year, I could get a week where I run 20 miles in a week at that pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the order want to run fast and we want to break free from conventional running thinking. Let’s take some more interesting goals. Hope this frees your mind a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

Like something you need a degree or two to really understand. But it really isn’t all that mysterious. Everyone already knows some biomechanics. If you jump off a balcony and land feet first, you’re probably well aware that you’ll break an ankle or a leg. Look you’re a natural! We don’t need to be doctors, we just want to know enough to run fast. If we’re going to run fast we have to learn to think for ourselves and not just go off of conventional or trend-based wisdom. So let’s talk about something every runner should have an opinion about, your stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to live on the edge between injury and speed you should know what different kinds of strides are doing for you. It’s plainly obvious (I hope) that the fastest way to run is on your toes. You get maximum power from your calves that way. Try running that way for 10 miles, however, and you’re likely to end up with some kind of injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that in order to prevent injury you should run with more of your foot on the ground and in fact you would be right in saying that would prevent a calf for ankle injury. It could be good or bad for your feet, but I’ll leave that as a puzzle for you to think about. But now you’d be dealing with a different issue. You see, preventing injury in a running stride is all about you that force gets distributed to the various joints in your body. Your body is like a spring. The more coils in an otherwise identical spring, the more distributed the force is and the less likely it is permanently deform or fail. The same principle applies to your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think of the body has having a few different coils: feet, ankles, knees, hips, and back. Perhaps there are more. Decide for yourself. So when your foot strikes the ground the force first goes into your foot and then gets transferred into your ankle, then to your knees, then to your hip, and finally to your back. The more each of those stages flex, the less force it will transfer to the next stage. So if you run on your toes, your foot and ankle can absorb that much more force and pass less to your knees and hips and back. Now you know why sprinters run on their toes; they have the maximum amount of force to deal with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if you run in trainers and strike the ground with your heel? In that case you’re essentially taking the ankle and foot out of the equation. All the force from the impact travels through those joints straight into your knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t necessarily a bad thing and doesn’t mean you should always run on your midsoles (a happy balance between heel striking and running on your toes, my personal favorite stride and the most popular trend right now (although prescribing a stride to runners is going out of style)). What you should do with this knowledge is use it to your advantage and choose when to use what stride. If your ankles are hurting, go ahead and heel strike for a while. If your having issues with your back then try getting on your toes more. Learn about your body, experiment with it, and run fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Treadmills]]></title><description><![CDATA[Treadmills hold no glory for the runner.

The treadmill is where you go when you don’t want to face the cold of winter. The treadmill is where you go for a nice cushy bouncy surface to run on so you don’t need strong joint. You don’t need to be connected with your body on a treadmill because you can put on a program and forget about it. You don’t even need to face the pain your body experiences because you can put on a Netflix drama to distract you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treadmills are loud. Treadmills are smelly. Treadmills are usually in a stuffy, dusty gym. The have unwieldy buttons. They’re incredibly dangerous to fall off of! Some treadmills are unpowered. That doesn’t work too well. The experience of being on a treadmill is bad every single time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, treadmills are an essential tool for the runner. We runners want to run far and fast. We don’t listen to our bodies anymore. We’ve transcended. But sometimes, the only thing I can do during recovery is run a limited distance, for a limited time, on a bouncy awful treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tools For Running]]></title><description><![CDATA[Running shoes are a wealth of interest for a runner.

As I’ve matured in the sport, I’ve expanded my arsenal of running shoes to be prepared to run in every situation. These are my meditations on running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My philosophy: Choosing running shoe is about teetering on the edge of speed and injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trainers: They’re designed to keep you from getting injured (as far as I can tell). They’re bulky, they have a huge drop restricting the power generated by your calves, and tend to be inflexible as well. I only run in these when I’m injured in my ankle or foot because they’re slow and boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Drop Trainers: These tend to be my preferred running shoe. They make it easy to strike with the midsole or otherwise take the impact into some part of the forefoot. This is important because it allows you to take your impact into your ankle instead of just your knee and you hip. For this reason these are actually the ideal shoe to keep from getting injured. You can also get more power and run faster than you can in trainers. Altra brand running shoes are zero drop which is really great but they can be really tough on your calves if you’re not careful. The Brooks Pure Running series helped me ease into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Flats: I use these when I want to run fast on roads. They are the minimal amount of shoe you need to keep your skin off the pavement. I love these shoes, but I can’t help but feel guilty for crushing my joints on the pavement with no cushioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikes: I only use these on the track. Obviously the spikes give traction, but some have a more interesting feature. They have a negative drop. Yes the toe has more shoe under it than the ankle. This really gets you on your toes and you can really fly. It’s thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barefoot: Barefoot running is not fast and gets you injured. I have no reason to ever run barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more kinds of shoes out there like trail shoes, sandals, Vibrams, Nike Free series shoes, etc. I haven’t tried any of them so I can’t comment, but given their commercial success, I imagine choosing a running shoe is much deeper than I know&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
