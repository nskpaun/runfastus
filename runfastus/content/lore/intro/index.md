title: Runfastus Lives
---

Long, long ago, Runfastus lived happily during the day and during the night. Runfastus ran quickly as he could over rock and over dust. Runfastus faced many conflicts and drew many followers. These are the legends of him.

The order was started in ancient times by Runfastus for reasons and it
attracted ameteur runners. The order lies dormant for centuries at a time
but always leaves its mark on history. Now the order has reemerged. Run
fast.
